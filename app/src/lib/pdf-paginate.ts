/**
 * Page assembly for the built-in PDF export ("导出为 PDF（图片）").
 *
 * `html2pdf.js` rasterises the whole document with html2canvas and hands that
 * one tall image to jsPDF, which slices it at a fixed page height. Those slice
 * lines know nothing about text: a paragraph or a code line that happens to sit
 * on a boundary gets sheared in half. The pagebreak plugin's `avoid` list is
 * meant to prevent that, but it works in *CSS* pixels while jsPDF slices
 * *raster* pixels — the two grids only agree while the rendered container
 * measures exactly what the plugin assumed, and they drift apart the moment
 * anything about the page size, the margins or the capture scale is off. A
 * long document then collects that drift page after page, and lines start
 * getting cut deeper in the document.
 *
 * So the export paginates the raster itself: for every nominal boundary, look
 * for a *clean* cut line — a row with no ink in it, i.e. the leading between
 * two lines of text — and rebuild the image as whole pages, each exactly
 * `pageHeightPx` tall with its content pinned to the top of the page. jsPDF
 * still does the slicing, but every slice now lands on a row we picked, so no
 * glyph can be cut in half. A page that had to give up a few rows to reach a
 * clean line simply ends with a little more white (and a long document may
 * need one more page than a blind slice would).
 *
 * Tables need a second rule: their column borders put ink on every row, so no
 * row inside a table is ever clean. There the cut goes between two table rows
 * instead (#337) — see `isStructuralRowData`.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately free of app state so it can be unit tested
 * (see `pdf-paginate.test.ts`) and driven from the browser harness
 * (`pdf-harness.html`).
